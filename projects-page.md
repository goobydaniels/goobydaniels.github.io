    <b>Over the course of my game development career I have worked on a number of different projects within both 2D and 3D environments, spanning multiple game engines, programming languages, and topics. Below is an almost comprehensive list of all of the projects I have worked on over the years, along with some plans for future ones as well, so take a look around and hopefully you’ll find a project that catches your eye!

## <b>Choo Choo Boom Boom (Working title), 2026 Spring Semester (Still in development!)</b>

    Choo Choo Boom Boom is an on rails shooter in which you are on a train equipped with cannons trying to take out an otherworldly entity that is attacking your city. Choo Choo Boom Boom stemmed from the idea of what would be a literal on rails shooter. You can’t get more on rails than a train. So we took that train and strapped an explosive cannon on it.

## You're It! Fall, 2025 Semester (Still in development!)

    You're It! is a local multiplayer game for up to four people. Chase your friends around the playground and tag them! Players can jump, slide, and dive around the map to catch or evade. For every second you're it, your timer will go down. Run out of time, and you're out! Be the last one left to win!
    <br>
    You're It was my first semester Capstone project, You're It was an idea for a game that I had in my head for a long time before development during capstone even began, I had developed a small prototype for it as a way to familiarize myself more with Unreal Engine and then when time began for the first semester of Capstone development to begin I threw You're It in as a potential game that our team could develop together. After three weeks of fleshing out the prototype for You're It as well as working on a few other prototypes for the other ideas the team had, we took all of them to be tested, and You're It came back with flying colors, the people who played the prototype were already in love with the movement and it wasn't even near a finished state, so because of this we choose to continue developing You're It as our team's main Capstone project.
    <br>
    Unfortunately, our game was not selected to move forward with the greenlight process but I didn't let that deter me from continuing to work on the game, as you can see from the header, I personally am continuing it's development, currently I am working on getting the game properly networked so that it can be played both online and locally, so look out for it on Steam whenever I get around to finishing it.

## Brick Bash GameBoy Game, 2025 Fall Semester

    This project was my final for my Computer Architecture class. The underlying requirement for this final was to utilize assembly programming in some kind of long term project, many options were presented to me but I chose to take on the challenge of making a Game Boy game, which are all completely written in assembly.
    <br>
    You can read about my process while making this project and download the final project here: (You will need a Game Boy emulator to actually play the game!!! For the project I used Emulicious)

## Domain Expansion, 2025 Global Game Jam

    <b>
    This project was for the 2025 Global Game Jam that I participated in while studying abroad in Montreal, where I was a part of a team of 7, and we were given 48 hours to complete our game. The theme for this game jam was Bubble and the other constraints my team wanted to use were Y2K and Pop. The idea for the game was to reference the .com bubble where the player must buy and sell domain names in order to make the most amount of money possible before the .com bubble bursts.
    <br>
    For this project we used Unity and I was tasked to create a random code creator, code validity checker, dynamic trend system, dynamic in-game economy, and randomly placed pop-up ui elements.
