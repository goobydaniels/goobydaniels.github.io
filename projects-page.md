    <b>Over the course of my game development career I have worked on a number of different projects within both 2D and 3D environments, spanning multiple game engines, programming languages, and topics. Below is an almost comprehensive list of all of the projects I have worked on over the years, along with some plans for future ones as well, so take a look around and hopefully you’ll find a project that catches your eye!

## Brick Bash GameBoy Game, 2025 Fall Semester
<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="1" style="text-align: center;">
    <b>
    This project was my final for my Computer Architecture class. The underlying requirement for this final was to utilize assembly programming in some kind of long term project, many options were presented to me but I chose to take on the challenge of making a Game Boy game, which are all completely written in assembly.
    <br>
    You can read about my process while making this project and download the final project here: (You will need a Game Boy emulator to actually play the game!!! For the project I used Emulicious)
