## **About me!!!**

Hmm what to say
*  I am a Game Programming major at Champlain College with a minor in Computer Science and Math
*  I grew up in a small farm town Ellington, Connecticut

    With introductions out of the way, allow me to lay out some more info about myself!
    <br>
    I grew up in a small farm town in Connecticut called Ellington, and I have had an interest and passion for video games, both playing them and making them. Playing and talking about games with others was one of the first ways that I can remember making my first friends at school, and funnily enough is still one of the main ways I make new friends to this day. So ever since I was young I knew that I wanted to do as much as I could with video games, I always had this dream of being able to one day be able to make my own games and share them with others so that they could enjoy them and hopefully be as happy as I was when I would play them.
    <br>
    So after being introduced to it one day at a friend’s house, at age 10 I made a roblox account and began playing games there, and then around age 12 I learned about Roblox Studio, and now realizing that I now had the ability to trying and learn how to make my own games for a platform that I loved playing, I immediately jumped in and the rest is history
    <br>
    <br>
    So to give a TL:DR I want to make games that people enjoy and can have fun playing, video games have always meant a lot to me and I wouldn’t be who I am today without them, so I want to give back to what made me who I am and give others the same chance that I had to feel as happy as I was when I was in their shoes.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
